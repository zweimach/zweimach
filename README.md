### 👋 Hi there!

My name is Ananda Umamil, a self-taught software engineer from Indonesia 🇮🇩.

I have a passion for computer science and mathematics.  
I used to hate math but then fell in love with it because of Haskell and functional programming.  
I'm an avid functional programmer, prefer to use pure functions when applicable.  
I'm also a supporter and consumer of open source, willing to contribute if possible.  
I spent my time building web applications and text-processing tools.

### ⚡ Fun fact

- I'm deeply in love with Haskell ❤️ & Type-Level Programming
- I'm currently interested in compilers
