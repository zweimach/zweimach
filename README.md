### 👋 Hi! My name is Ananda Umamil

I'm a self-taught software engineer from Indonesia 🇮🇩.

I have a passion for computer science and mathematics.  
I used to hate math but then fell in love with it because of Haskell and functional programming.  
I build web applications and text-processing tools.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zweimach), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zweimach), or you can visit [my website](https://zweimach.org).

⚡ Fun fact:

- have been programming since 13 years old
- first language is C
- most fluent language is JavaScript
- favorite language is Haskell ❤️
- currently interested in compilers and text-processing tools
