### 👋 Hi there!

My name is Ananda Umamil, a self-taught software engineer from Indonesia 🇮🇩.

I have a passion for computer science and text-processing tools like compilers and pretty printers.  
I'm also an avid functional programmer and an occasional open source contributor.  
I love Haskell ❤️ & Rust.
